The Janata Dal-United (JD-U) Sunday decided not to be a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance outside Bihar. At its national executive meeting held at the residence of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, the party also decided to go it alone in the upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Haryana and Delhi.


Sundayâ€™s meeting was chaired by Nitish Kumar and attended by party vice-president Prashant Kishor, state presidents and other top leaders, including MPs and MLAs. Sources said Nitish Kumar appealed to the leaders to strengthen the party outside Bihar and focus on its month-long drive to recruit new members.
